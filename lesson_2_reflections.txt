What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
All files in the repository will be track as a single unit. That is important when the files are related to each other, and a change in one file can affect how the other files work.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers? The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository that allows the user to commit only the files he/she wants.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
The staging area allows you to work with only some files at a time and don't have to commit all files where changes were not made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches can be helpful when we want to make changes that will cause the program to act different than the master version. Branches allow us to make these changes and still have the master version. The language example was a good one.
